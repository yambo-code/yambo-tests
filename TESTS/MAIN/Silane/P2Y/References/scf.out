     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Waiting for input...
     Reading input from standard input

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = HSE ( 1 412 4 0)
     EXX-fraction              =        0.25
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want


     gamma-point specific algorithms are used

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
