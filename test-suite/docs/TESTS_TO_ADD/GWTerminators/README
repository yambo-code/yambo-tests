I implemented the 0-order terminator effective-energy technique(EET), and
the Bruneval-Gonze terminator only for the self-energy

with the verbosity -V qp it is sufficile to uncomment the line:

#GWTerm                      # [GW] Use a terminator for the self-energy

to have the 0-order EET terminator

If one uncomments the GWTerm flag and gives the pole position it is possible to use the 
Brouneval-Gonze terminato

GwEnComp=-27.21138     eV    # [GW] If <= 0 use 0-order EET ; > 0 the Bruneval-Gonze terminator



PROBLEMS and KNOWN ISSUES

Both terminators do not work for the head and the wings of the dielectric constant
therefore all conduction bands are required to converge this two parts. This is explained
in the paper of Berger, Sottile and Reining, and that's the reason why I did not implemented
it for the dielectric constant but only for the self-energy.
Another important point the terminator have a strong effect on the absolute value of the 
correction but a smaller effect on the relative differences as the gap.

Some convergence test in the PNG figures

I added the Bruneval-Gonze terminator on request of Fabio Trani, ask to him for tests
and results, anyway the formula is the same of the EET with the only difference
that the pole is given as input
